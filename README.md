# Streamix
Program to connect YouTube live stream comments with serial com port to communicate with arduino

Upload code to arduino - analyse if inputs add up with your current setup
Start exe file or execute notebook and in the form paste link to any current live stream from youtube (yours or not). No login required anywhere.
Press connect and start typing comments - currently numbers from 0-20 in that stream - your arduino should react within 3-4 seconds.
